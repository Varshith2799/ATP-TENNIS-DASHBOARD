# ATP Tennis Dashboard

This project analyzes ATP tennis matches using Tableau to visualize player performance across various surfaces.

## Project Overview

The dashboard provides insights into:

- **Top 10 Players by Total Wins:** Breakdown by surface (Clay, Grass, Hard).
- **Player Wins Over Time:** Trends in player victories across months.
- **Wins by Player & Surface:** Distribution of wins based on court type.
- **Head to Head Performance:** Comparison of player matchups.
- **Surface Distribution:** Proportion of wins across different surfaces.

## Key Insights

1. **Surface Dominance:** 
   - The majority of wins occur on **hard courts**, followed by clay and grass.
   - Certain players exhibit dominance on specific surfaces, with notable trends.

2. **Top Performing Players:** 
   - Players like **Djokovic N., Federer R., and Nadal R.** lead in total wins.
   - Each player shows varying strengths across different court types.

3. **Performance Trends Over Time:** 
   - There are visible fluctuations in player wins over time, indicating performance peaks and slumps.
   - A significant dip can be observed in certain months, possibly due to off-seasons or injuries.

4. **Head-to-Head Battles:** 
   - Some players have clear advantages over specific opponents, while others face tough competition.
   - The rivalry trends between top competitors can be analyzed.

5. **Grass Court Rarity:** 
   - Wins on grass are significantly lower compared to other surfaces, emphasizing the limited number of grass-court tournaments.
